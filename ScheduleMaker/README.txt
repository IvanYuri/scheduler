			Automating process of schedule using Python

Altought automating a staff schedule sounds like a simple ideia it something that yet is commonly done manually.
During a meeting with Datakult on Discord he mentioned the idea that we do not sell technology what we do actually
is making people's lives easier by selling solutions, one of those was that the proccess of 
creating a timetable for your staff as a manager can be overwhelming. But it can be easily done by machine automation.

So it sound simple and doable and I want to try writing a code for it myself, in order to achieve this I will
first organise in a list the things that need to be done. Altought this format can change along the week I will
try to develop a diary to keep up with all the alterations while I'm on it.

So the first list of ideias is:
use CSV or SQL to store and manage the staff,
the possible database should contain staff information (NAME, ID)
the other possible table should contain info about the shifts and the working areas. (SHIFTS, FUNCTION)

create a code to fill the avaiable SHIFTS for each FUNCTION with the staff NAME and ID.
it also has to be easily manipulated as needed.

scheduler not ready, it was done and presented today unfortunally it behaved badly during presentation
but that is probably my fault when I was redirecting it through files.

Idea presented and explained as basic structure but yet not ready for production
